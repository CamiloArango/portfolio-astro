	<p>
		As a self-taught full-stack developer with roots in Colombia and now calling Panama my home, I thrive on crafting exceptional digital experiences. My current toolkit features React, NextJS, and Astro for front-end development, ensuring sleek, fast, and SEO-friendly web applications.
	</p>
	<p>Equally passionate about automation, I harness Python to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and innovate solutions that stand out.</p>
